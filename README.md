## 📐 Methodology
The analysis follows a structured data analytics workflow:
1. Collected annual Amazon sales and advertising expenditure.
2. Performed descriptive statistics to understand min, max, mean, and variance.
3. Built a linear regression model to quantify impact.
4. Evaluated model performance using R, R², p-values, and F-statistics.
5. Interpreted coefficients to estimate sales increase per $1B advertising spend.
6. Summarized insights for decision-makers through visualization and clear explanations.

## 📊 Key Results & Insights

According to the analytical summary:
- Sales ranged from: $88.99B to $513.98B  
- Advertising ranged from: $3.3B to $20.6B  
- Average sales: $265.90B  
- Average advertising: $9.56B  

### 📈 Regression Performance
- Correlation (Multiple R): 0.9749 → Extremely strong positive relationship  
- R² = 0.9505 → *95% of sales variation explained by advertising*  
- Adjusted R² = 0.9434  
- Std. Error = 37.62

### 📊 ANOVA Significance
- F-statistic: 134.32  
- p-value: 8.03e-06 → Highly statistically significant relationship  

### 📉 Coefficients
- Intercept: 19.21  
- Advertising coefficient: 25.82  
  - Each additional $1B in advertising is associated with +$25.82B in Amazon sales  
  - Coefficient is statistically significant (p < 0.05)

### 🧩 Interpretation
The analysis reveals a strong, statistically significant relationship between advertising expenditure and sales.  
Advertising appears to be a major driver of annual revenue changes, explaining ~95% of sales variability.  
However, correlation does not imply causation; other market factors may also influence sales.
